## About

This project aims to create a free, open-source, and beginner-friendly crash course for data structures and algorithms.

- Animated illustrations, easy-to-understand contents, and a smooth learning curve help beginners explore the "knowledge map" of data structures and algorithms;
- Run code with just one click, help readers improve their programming skills and understand the working principle of algorithms and the underlying implementation of data structures;
- We encourage readers to help each other. Questions and comments are usually answered within two days;

If you find this book helpful, please give it a Star :star: to support us, thank you!

## Recommendations

> "An easy-to-understand introductory book on data structures and algorithms, which guides readers to learn by thinking and practicing, strongly recommended for algorithm beginners."
>
> **—— Junhui Deng, Professor of Computer Science, Tsinghua University**

> "If I had Hello Algorithm when I was learning data structures and algorithms, it would have been 10 times easier!"
>
> **—— Mu Li, Senior Principal Scientist, Amazon**
