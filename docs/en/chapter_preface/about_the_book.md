## Audience

!!! success "Prerequisites"

    You should know how to write and read simple code in at least one programming language.

If you are an **algorithm beginner**, you have never learned algorithms before, or you have accumulated some algorithm experience, but you only have a vague understanding of data structures and algorithms, and you are constantly jumping between "Yep" and "hmm", then this book is for you!

If you are an **algorithm proficient**, you have accumulated a certain amount of algorithm experience, and have been exposed to most types of questions, then the content of this book may be slightly basic for you, but it can still bring you the following value:

- The book is not long, which can help you review your algorithm knowledge in a nutshell.
- The book contains many comparative and summary algorithm contents, which can help you sort out your algorithm knowledge system.
- The code in the book implements various classic data structures and algorithms, which can be used as a "algorithms questions library".

If you are an **algorithm expert**, then you have my respect! I hope you can take the time to provide some advice and suggestions, or [join us to collaborate](https://www.hello-algo.com/chapter_preface/contribution/), and help algorithms learners by producing better materials, thank you!

### Complexity Analysis

We will first introduce the evaluation factors of data structures and algorithms, the evaluation methods of algorithm efficiency, and the concept of computational complexity.

Then, from the **asymptotic upper bound of functions** , we will introduce **time complexity** and **space complexity** respectively, including calculation methods, common types, examples, etc. At the same time, we will analyze the relationship and difference between the **worst, best, and average** time complexity.

### Data Structures

We will first introduce the **basic data types** that are commonly used, and how they are stored in memory.

Then, we will introduce two **data structure classification methods**, including logical structure and physical structure.

After that, we will introduce **array, linked list, stack, queue, hash table, tree, heap, graph** and other data structures, and we will focus on the following content:

- Basic definitions: the designing ideas, and the purposes served by these data structures;
- Primary characteristics: the pros and cons of various data operations;
- Common operations: such as access, update, insert, delete, traversal, search, etc.;
- Common types: the common types encountered in algorithm questions or engineering practice;
- Typical applications: typical algorithms that are often used with these data structures;
- Implementations: for important data structures, we will provide complete implementation examples;

### Algorithms

Including **searching algorithms, sorting algorithms, searching and backtracking, dynamic programming, and divide-and-conquer algorithms**, containing the following:

- Basic definitions: the designing ideas of algorithms;
- Primary characteristics: the preconditions, pros and cons of each algorithm;
- Algorithm efficiency: worst and average time complexity, space complexity;
- Implementations: complete algorithm implementations, and optimization measures;
- Example questions: adding example questions to deepen your understanding;

!!! tip "Preparation"

    1. [Install your coding environment](https://www.hello-algo.com/chapter_preface/installation/), if you have already installed it, please skip this step
    2. See [How to use this book](https://www.hello-algo.com/chapter_preface/suggestions/#_4) for code download and usage instructions

## Style Guide

- The * symbol trailing the title indicates that it is an optional chapter. If you are short on time, you can skip these chapters first.
- Important syllables will be marked as italic, such as *Array*. Mixing up the syllables will cause unnecessary ambiguity, so it is best to remember these syllables, so that they can be used when reading related materials in the future.
- Important content, summary sentences will be marked as **bold**, this kind of text is worth special attention.
- The names of proprietary nouns and words with specific meanings will be marked with " ", to avoid ambiguity.
- In engineering practice, each language has its own comment conventions; while this book gives up some of the comment conventions in order to achieve a more compact content layout. The comments are divided into three types: header comments, content comments, and multi-line comments.

=== "Java"

    ```java title=""
    /* header comments, used to mark functions, classes, test cases, etc. */
    
    // content comments, used to explain code

    /**
     * multi-line
     * comments
     */
    ```

=== "C++"

    ```cpp title=""
    /* header comments, used to mark functions, classes, test cases, etc. */
    
    // content comments, used to explain code

    /**
     * multi-line
     * comments
     */
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python title=""
    """ header comments, used to mark functions, classes, test cases, etc. """
    
    # content comments, used to explain code

    """
    multi-line
    comments
    """
    ```

=== "Go"

    ```go title=""
    /* header comments, used to mark functions, classes, test cases, etc. */
    
    // content comments, used to explain code

    /**
     * multi-line
     * comments
     */
    ```

=== "JavaScript"

    ```js title=""
    /* header comments, used to mark functions, classes, test cases, etc. */
    
    // content comments, used to explain code

    /**
     * multi-line
     * comments
     */
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```typescript title=""
    /* header comments, used to mark functions, classes, test cases, etc. */
    
    // content comments, used to explain code

    /**
     * multi-line
     * comments
     */
    ```

=== "C"

    ```c title=""
    /* header comments, used to mark functions, classes, test cases, etc. */
    
    // content comments, used to explain code

    /**
     * multi-line
     * comments
     */
    ```

=== "C#"

    ```csharp title=""
    /* header comments, used to mark functions, classes, test cases, etc. */
    
    // content comments, used to explain code

     */
    ```

## Key Features of This Book *

??? abstract "Default collapsed, can be skipped"

    **Practice comes first.** We know that it is far from enough to just read books when learning English. We need to listen, speak, and write more, and practice in order to cultivate language sense and accumulate experience. Programming languages are also languages, so the learning method should be similar, and we need to be accustomed to walking through elegant code, writing more code and thinking about the logic behind the code.
    
    The theoretical part of this book is relatively concise, mainly divided into two categories: one is the basic and necessary concepts, to cultivate the reader's intuitive understanding of algorithms; the second is essential classifications, comparisons or summaries, which is to give you a "god view" and hard overview of all the key points, so that you can form your own subconscious understanding.
    
    The practice part is mainly made up of examples and code. The code is accompanied by brief comments, and complex examples will be presented as visually as possible. I strongly recommend that the readers type out the code themselves, if time is limited, at least read, copy and run the code line by line, and combine with the explanation to digest the code.
    
    **Visualized learning.** Since the dawn of the information age, the endeavor of visualizing information has never ended. The media has transformed from text messages, to emails with text and image, to GIFs, to short (long) videos, interactive Web, and 3D games. The magnitude of information visualization is getting higher than ever, they are more unified with human senses, and the efficiency of spreading information has skyrocketed. The tech industry is also moving towards visualization, take the iPhone as an example, it is a highly visualized product compared to conventional devices, with articulately designed fonts, themes, and animations, etc.
    
    In the past several years, short videos have become one of the most popular form of media, capable of delivering highly dense information, and can provide a comfortable consumption experience. Reading is different, there is a natural "distance" between the reader and the book, we will get tired, distracted, and will think about other things while reading, we will mark the sentences we like, and think about the meaning of a paragraph, this "distance" gives us a sense of freedom and the capability of stopping for a moment and think about what we just read.
    
    As a beginner's guide, I wish to maintain the "slow pace" of books, but also to avoid putting too much "distance" between the reader and the book, and to try to sink the knowledge into that clever little brain of yours. I will utilize visualization techniques (e.g. illustrations, animations), and try to explain complex concepts and abstract examples as clearly as possible.

    **Simplified contents.** Most classic textbooks try to cover almost every aspect of the subject, and the thoroughness is the reason why they are popular. However, for beginners who want to get started quickly, the practicality of these textbooks is quite poor. This book will avoid introducing unnecessary concepts, terms, definitions, etc., and will avoid unnecessary theoretical analysis, after all, this is not a hardcore textbook, our main goal is to get you started as rapidly as possible.
    
    When introducing some fun examples from real life, which are quite suitable as a prelude to key content, or as a supplement to the explanation. However, we will try to keep the content as concise as possible, and avoid adding too many extra elements, which may make the reader lose focus and miss the key points, which is also something this book should avoid.
    
    Coding is like writing, they should both pursue "beauty". This book tries to make the code beautiful, and ensure the consistency of variable naming, uniform spacing and line breaks, aligned indentation, and neat comments, etc.
