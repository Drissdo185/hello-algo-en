<h2 align="center"> Preface </h2>

Two years ago, I shared my solutions for the *Coding Interview* series on LeetCode CN, which was well received by many readers. During such period, I answered numerous questions from readers, and the most common one was "How to get started with algorithms". Gradually, I became fascinated with this topic.

Going blindly into the sea of algorithm questions seems to be the most common approach, as it is easy and effective. However, this is like playing the game of "Minesweeper". People with robust self-learning strategies can easily clear the mines one by one, while those with weak foundations are likely to be blown up and retreat in frustration. Reading textbooks is also a common practice, but for students who are preparing for the industry, graduation season, resume submission, and interview preparation have already taken up most of their time and energy. Thick textbooks often become a daunting challenge.

If you are presented with similar challenges, then I'm glad that this book finds you. This book is my answer to this problem. Although it may not be correct, it is at least an educated attempt. This book may not be enough to guarantee you an offer, but it will guide you to explore the "knowledge map" of data structures and algorithms, helping you understand the shape, size, and distribution of different "mines", and master various "mine sweeping methods". With these skills, I believe you can deal with algorithm questions and literature reading with more confidence, and gradually build a complete knowledge system.
